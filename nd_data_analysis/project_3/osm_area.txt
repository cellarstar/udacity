REASON FOR PICKING THE AREA:
I am based out of Austria, Europe working for GE. One of our businesses site is located
in Waukesha, WI. I have been in Waukesha and the surrounding area already several times
for professional reasons. Definitely the area in US I know best and even the area which 
I most probably will travel to again. To get more insight about the area for future travels
but also to get more information where my colleagues live, I have chosen Waukesha County 
area for my investigation during this project.
